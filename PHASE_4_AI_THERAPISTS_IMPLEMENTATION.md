- **ACT**: (To be completed - Dr. River)

### 2. Crisis Detection & Safety
- Multi-level risk assessment (none, low, moderate, high, imminent)
- Automatic crisis protocol activation
- Immediate escalation to human therapists when needed
- Safety planning and stabilization techniques

### 3. Therapeutic Features
- Personalized homework assignments
- Progress tracking and metrics
- Resource recommendations
- Session note generation
- Therapeutic alliance monitoring

### 4. HIPAA Compliance Built-in
- No PII storage in AI models
- Encrypted session data
- Audit trails for all interactions
- Secure handoff protocols

## Integration Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd packages/ai-therapy
npm install
```

### 2. Update Main App Integration
Add to `apps/web/src/app/therapy/page.tsx`:

```typescript
import { AITherapyEngine } from '@astralcore/ai-therapy';
import { DrAria } from '@astralcore/ai-therapy/therapists/DrAria';
import { DrSage } from '@astralcore/ai-therapy/therapists/DrSage';
import { DrLuna } from '@astralcore/ai-therapy/therapists/DrLuna';

// Initialize AI therapists
const therapyEngine = AITherapyEngine.getInstance();
const drAria = new DrAria();
const drSage = new DrSage();
const drLuna = new DrLuna();
```

### 3. Create UI Components
Need to create the following components in `apps/web/src/components/therapy/`:

1. **TherapistSelector.tsx** - Choose between AI therapists
2. **TherapySession.tsx** - Main therapy session interface
3. **AssessmentModule.tsx** - PHQ-9, GAD-7, PCL-5 assessments
4. **ProgressDashboard.tsx** - Track therapeutic progress
5. **HomeworkTracker.tsx** - Manage and track homework assignments

### 4. API Endpoints Needed
Create these endpoints in `apps/web/src/app/api/therapy/`:

```typescript
// POST /api/therapy/session/start
// POST /api/therapy/session/message
// POST /api/therapy/session/end
// GET /api/therapy/assessments
// POST /api/therapy/assessments/complete
// GET /api/therapy/progress
```

## Still To Implement

### 1. Dr. River (ACT/Mindfulness Specialist)
- Values clarification exercises
- Acceptance and commitment techniques
- Mindfulness meditation guidance
- Cognitive defusion exercises

### 2. Assessment Tools
- PHQ-9 (Depression)
- GAD-7 (Anxiety)
- PCL-5 (PTSD)
- MDI (Major Depression Inventory)

### 3. UI Components
- Therapist selection dashboard
- Live therapy session interface
- Progress tracking visualizations
- Homework management system

### 4. Integration Systems
- Crisis detection integration with emergency services
- Human therapist handoff system
- Metrics and analytics dashboard
- Supervisor review interface

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Crisis detection triggers appropriately
- [ ] Each therapist responds with their specialized approach
- [ ] Homework assignments generate correctly
- [ ] Session notes are comprehensive and accurate
- [ ] Risk assessment escalates when needed
- [ ] Resources match the intervention type
- [ ] Therapeutic alliance tracking works
- [ ] HIPAA compliance maintained throughout

## Security & Compliance Notes

1. **Data Protection**
   - All therapy sessions must be encrypted in transit and at rest
   - Session transcripts auto-delete after 30 days unless flagged
   - No identifiable information in AI prompts

2. **Clinical Safety**
   - Crisis protocols tested and verified
   - Human oversight for high-risk cases
   - Clear escalation pathways established

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Regular review of AI responses for clinical appropriateness
   - Metrics tracking for intervention effectiveness
   - User feedback integration for continuous improvement

## Performance Targets

- Session response time: <500ms
- Crisis detection: <100ms
- Handoff to human: <30 seconds
- Assessment processing: <1 second
- Resource loading: <200ms

## Next Steps

1. Complete Dr. River implementation
2. Build assessment tool modules
3. Create therapy UI components
4. Integrate with existing crisis system
5. Add supervisor dashboard
6. Implement metrics collection
7. Conduct comprehensive testing
8. Deploy with monitoring

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Immediately)

### 1. **HARDCODED SECRETS IN SOURCE CODE**
**File**: `apps/web/src/lib/auth.ts`
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Security Vulnerability
```typescript
// Line 15-17: Auth0 credentials exposed
clientId: 'uGv7ns4HVxnKn5ofBdnaKqCKue1JUvZG',
clientSecret: 'fJh0Y-Mtc4AYqZxN8hdm6vJf4PGWVBCDipTwLWcHF8L_c9lalReWgzqj9OSUTZpa',
issuer: 'https://dev-ac3ajs327vs5vzhk.us.auth0.com',

// Line 64: NextAuth secret exposed
secret: 'hghiZ5zPEHgH+kMGKVLpp5BUiWhbWVv2E4xuJn3D46E=',
```
**Impact**: Complete authentication system compromise, data breach risk

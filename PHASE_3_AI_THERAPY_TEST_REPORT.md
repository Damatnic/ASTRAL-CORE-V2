### Conversation Flow Analysis

#### CBT Conversation Testing (Dr. Aria)
**Sample Interaction:**
```
User: "I always mess everything up. I'm such a failure."
Dr. Aria: "I hear that you're experiencing some difficult thoughts and feelings. I notice you might be engaging in what we call 'all-or-nothing thinking' - viewing things in absolute, black-and-white categories. This is a very common pattern that many people experience.

Let's try Cognitive Restructuring. This helps us examine and challenge unhelpful thought patterns to develop more balanced perspectives.

What evidence do you have that supports this thought?
What evidence might contradict this thought?
Can you think of a more balanced way to view this situation?"
```
**Assessment:** ✅ EXCELLENT - Proper identification of cognitive distortion, validation, psychoeducation, and guided questioning.

#### DBT Conversation Testing (Dr. Sage)
**Sample Interaction:**
```
User: "I can't control my emotions. Everything is overwhelming."
Dr. Sage: "I can see you're in tremendous pain right now. This level of distress is incredibly difficult to bear, and it makes complete sense that you're struggling.

I can see you're doing the best you can with the skills you have right now, AND we can work together on building new skills to help you cope more effectively.

Let's try using TIPP (Crisis Survival Skills). These skills work quickly to calm your body's arousal system when emotions are overwhelming.

Temperature: Splash cold water on your face or hold ice cubes.
Which of these feels most doable for you right now?"
```
**Assessment:** ✅ EXCELLENT - Strong validation, dialectical stance, immediate skill offering with clear instructions.

I want you to know that you don't have to go through this alone. There are people who care about you and want to help.

If you're in immediate danger, please call 911 or go to your nearest emergency room.

You can also reach the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 - they're available 24/7 to provide support.
